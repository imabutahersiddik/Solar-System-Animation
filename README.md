## 📋 Planet Details

The animation includes all eight planets with scaled properties:

| Planet   | Orbital Period (Real) | Animation Period |
|----------|----------------------|------------------|
| Mercury  | 88 days             | 8.8 seconds      |
| Venus    | 225 days            | 22.5 seconds     |
| Earth    | 365 days            | 36.5 seconds     |
| Mars     | 687 days            | 68.7 seconds     |
| Jupiter  | 4,333 days          | 433.2 seconds    |
| Saturn   | 10,752 days         | 1075.2 seconds   |
| Uranus   | 30,664 days         | 3066.4 seconds   |
| Neptune  | 60,192 days         | 6019.2 seconds   |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Animations & Transformations)
- JavaScript (ES6+)

## 💻 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/imabutahersiddik/solar-system-animation.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd solar-system-animation
```

3. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## 🎯 Usage

Simply open the HTML file in a modern web browser. The animation will start automatically:
- Watch planets orbit around the sun
- Observe the twinkling stars in the background
- View the current UTC time
- Hover over planets to see their names

## 🔧 Customization

You can customize various aspects of the animation by modifying the CSS variables:

1. **Planet Sizes**:
```css
.mercury { width: 20px; height: 20px; }
.venus { width: 30px; height: 30px; }
/* etc... */
```

2. **Orbital Speeds**:
```css
#mercury-orbit { animation: rotate 8.8s linear infinite; }
#venus-orbit { animation: rotate 22.5s linear infinite; }
/* etc... */
```

3. **Star Density**:
```javascript
const numberOfStars = 300; // Adjust this number
```

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

- Chrome (latest version)
- Firefox (latest version)
- Safari (latest version)
- Edge (latest version)
- Opera (latest version)

## 🎨 Customizing Planet Images

The project uses external planet images. To use your own images:

1. Replace the image URLs in the CSS:
```css
.mercury { background-image: url('your-mercury-image.png'); }
.venus { background-image: url('your-venus-image.png'); }
/* etc... */
```

2. Recommended image specifications:
   - Format: PNG or JPG
   - Resolution: Minimum 256x256 pixels
   - Type: Spherical planet texture maps
   - Aspect ratio: 1:1 (square)

## ⚙️ Performance Optimization

The animation is optimized for performance using:
- CSS transforms for smooth animations
- RequestAnimationFrame for star animations
- Efficient DOM manipulation
- Hardware acceleration for animations
